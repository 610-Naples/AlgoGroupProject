THIS CODE CONTAINS 13 TASKS:

-----------------------------Nancy:
1.User Login Verification: Firstly, it is necessary to verify whether the student number entered by the user is in the CSV file. If it exists, the user can log in the system.
2.User information display: After logging in, the user can see the car information associated with his/her school number, including plate number, colour, make, country of manufacture, year of manufacture, price and warranty period.
3.Car Information Retrieval: Car information will be retrieved from another CSV file and this information will be displayed to the user.
4.Car ID Generation: Generate a unique Car ID for each car in the format of brand abbreviation + date + random number, e.g. PRO202103929.
5.Data Update: Update the user's query result and Car ID into the provided CSV file.
6.Search Function Implementation: Implement a search function that allows the user to find car information by Car ID. Either a linear search or a binary search algorithm can be used.
7.Sorting Algorithm Application: Sort the Car information using a subsumption sort or a quick sort algorithm to optimise the search efficiency.

------------------------------Bryan:
8. Provide an option to display an unsorted list of all car records in the company's database.
9. Allow users to view car records sorted by ID, price, or brand. Implement sorting using either Merge
Sort or Quicksort.
10. Enable users to search for the best-selling cars, sorted by brand name. Use Radix Sort, Bubble Sort,
or Selection Sort for sorting, and Binary Search for searching.
11. When a car is purchased, the system should generate a bill for the customer. This bill must include
the customer's name, customer ID, car ID, car brand, year of production, color, price, any applicable discount, and a unique random purchase order number. It should also display the total price of the purchase.
12. Users should be able to search for issued bills by customer ID or bill date. Implement this search using the Linear Search algorithm.
13. Thesystemshouldgenerateareportofallcompanypurchaseswithinaspecifiedperiod.Thisreport should include car details (ID, brand, color, customer name, exact date, and price) and the total price of all sold cars. Use a binary search algorithm to compile this list, and sort the items by price using Quicksort.
