THIS CODE CONTAINS SEVEN TASKS:
1.User Login Verification: Firstly, it is necessary to verify whether the student number entered by the user is in the CSV file. If it exists, the user can log in the system.
2.User information display: After logging in, the user can see the car information associated with his/her school number, including plate number, colour, make, country of manufacture, year of manufacture, price and warranty period.
3.Car Information Retrieval: Car information will be retrieved from another CSV file and this information will be displayed to the user.
4.Car ID Generation: Generate a unique Car ID for each car in the format of brand abbreviation + date + random number, e.g. PRO202103929.
5.Data Update: Update the user's query result and Car ID into the provided CSV file.
6.Search Function Implementation: Implement a search function that allows the user to find car information by Car ID. Either a linear search or a binary search algorithm can be used.
7.Sorting Algorithm Application: Sort the Car information using a subsumption sort or a quick sort algorithm to optimise the search efficiency.
